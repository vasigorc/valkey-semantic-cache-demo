## 🎯 Past Milestones

**Milestone 1: Project Initialization Complete** ✅

**What was accomplished:**

- Reviewed comprehensive project specification
- Answered clarifying questions about architecture and flow
- Made key technical decisions:
  - Language: Node.js + TypeScript
  - Database: Valkey with vector search
  - LLM: AWS Bedrock (Sonnet 4.5 + Titan Embeddings)
  - Orchestration: Docker Compose
  - Semantic threshold: 0.85
  - Seed approach: RDB snapshot
  - Data structure: Two-tier (vector index + content hash)
- Established collaboration workflow (Progress.md tracking)
- Created README.md and Progress.md

## 🚀 Current Milestone

**Milestone 2: Backend Scaffold & Valkey Connection**

**Goal**: Get a basic Express TypeScript server running and successfully connected to Valkey in Docker Compose

**Tasks:**

1. Create project directory structure
2. Initialize backend package.json with dependencies:
   - express
   - @valkey/valkey-glide
   - @aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime
   - typescript, @types/node, @types/express
   - ts-node-dev (for development)
3. Create basic Express server (src/index.ts)
4. Create Valkey client module (src/valkey/client.ts) with:
   - Connection retry logic
   - Health check function
5. Create docker-compose.yml with:
   - Valkey service with health check
   - Backend service with depends_on condition
6. Add health check endpoint to Express: GET /health
7. Verify entire stack starts successfully

**Success Criteria:**

- `docker-compose up` starts both services
- Backend connects to Valkey successfully
- GET /health returns 200 with status info
- No errors in console/logs

**Files to Create:**

```
backend/
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── valkey/
│       └── client.ts
docker-compose.yml
```

## 📝 Key Decisions Log

| Decision                                    | Rationale                                                                            | Date       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| **Language: Node.js + TypeScript**          | Full-stack coherence, rapid iteration, strong Valkey Glide support, AWS SDK maturity | 2025-11-07 |
| **Seed Method: RDB Snapshot**               | Simplicity, portability, consistent demo starting state                              | 2025-11-07 |
| **Data Structure: Two-tier**                | Valkey search limitations require separate vector index and content storage          | 2025-11-07 |
| **Similarity Threshold: 0.85**              | Industry standard, good balance between precision and recall                         | 2025-11-07 |
| **Show Similarity Scores**                  | Impressive for demos, helps understand semantic matching                             | 2025-11-07 |
| **Docker Compose with Health Checks**       | Ensures Valkey ready before backend starts, plus retry logic in code                 | 2025-11-07 |
| **Time Savings: Standardized Estimate**     | Consistent demo regardless of network conditions (2-3s LLM vs 50-100ms cache)        | 2025-11-07 |
| **Cost Calculation: Bedrock Token Pricing** | Real AWS costs demonstrate actual savings                                            | 2025-11-07 |
| **Only Embed Questions**                    | Search for similar questions, not answers. More efficient.                           | 2025-11-07 |
| **Progress.md + README.md**                 | README for external audience, Progress.md for development tracking                   | 2025-11-07 |
| **Configurable LLM Model**                  | Support Sonnet 4.0 and 4.5 via environment variable for deployment flexibility       | 2025-11-11 |
